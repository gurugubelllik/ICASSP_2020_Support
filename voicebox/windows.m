function w = windows(wtype,n,mode,p)
%WINDOWS Generate a standard windowing function (TYPE,N,MODE,P)
%
%	TYPE	is one of:
%
%			'blackman'
%			'kaiser'	   with parameter P (often called beta) (default P=8)
%			'gaussian'	truncated at +-P std deviations (default P=3)
%			'hamming'
%			'hanning'
%			'harris3'	3-term balckman-harris with 67dB sidelobes
%			'harris4'	4-term balckman-harris with 92dB sidelobes
%			'rectangle'
%			'triangle'
%
%	   N is either the number of points to generate. If N>1 is
%		a non-integer, then FLOOR(N) points will be generated.
%
%	   MODE determines the scaling and sampling of the window function and
%     is a text string with up to 3 characters whose meanings are given below. The
%     default is 'ubw' for window functions whose end points are non-zero and 'unw'
%     for window functions whose end points are zero (e.g. hanning window)
%
%         scaling:
%                  u = unscaled  with the peak of the underlying continuous
%                      window equalling unity. [default]
%                  p = scaled to make the actual peak unity
%                  d = scaled to make unity DC gain (summed sample values).
%                  e = scaled to make unity energy (summed squared sample values).
%
%         first and last samples (see note on periodicity below):
%                  b [both]    = The first and last samples are at the extreme ends of
%                                the window [default for most windows].
%                  n [neither] = The first and last samples are one sample away from the ends
%                                of the window [default for windows having zero end points].
%                  s [shifted] = The first and last samples are half a sample away from the
%                                ends of the window .
%                  l [left]    = The first sample is at the end of the window while the last
%                                is one sample away from the end .
%                  r [right]   = The first sample is one sample away from the end while the
%                                last is at the end of the window .
%       
%         whole/half window (see note on periodicity below):
%                  w = The whole window is included [default]
%                  c = The first sample starts in the centre of the window
%                  h = The first sample starts half a sample beyond the centre
%
% Periodicity:
%     The underlying period of the window function depends on the chosen mode combinations and
%     is given in the table below. For overlapping windows with perfect reconstruction choose
%     N to be an integer and modes 'ws', 'wl' or 'wr'.
